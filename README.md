# HackathonSunbeam
The 1Day Hackathon held at our institute,
in which me and my friend Sumama participated together in that hackathon and 
we are lucky enough to complete 80% of problem statement 
(making Blog application using Java JDBC) which is given to us.
That day i have not uploaded this project on my github, that's why i am uploading all the project code at once now.
